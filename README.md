# Random-Forest-Project
Publicly available data from lendingclub.com is explored to predict people with a profile with high probability to pay back the loans.  We used Random Forest Classifier on lending data from 2007-2010 and tried to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.
